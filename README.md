# Quiplash Clone (part 2)

This Project was created as a part of the Cloud Application Development module at the University of Southampton.

For this coursework we were tasked with creating a Quiplash Clone using Python and Azure for the backend API, and NodeJS, Javascript and Google Cloud for the frontend.

This is the second half of the coursework which involved creating two clients (first for the interactive devices, and the second as the main display device that everyone can see simultaneously), and the holding of the game state on a NodeJS server. Prompts and users will be called against the API created in the first part of the coursework. This part of the coursework will run the game aspect: People will enter prompts to be used (half of the prompts used will be taken from the azure database) submit the answers to the prompts, then score each others answers. Scoreboards will be displayed at the end of the game to showcase the winner. The server was deployed onto Google Cloud's services to support online play.

Unfortunately, due to us only having temporary free access to Azure and Google Cloud, the project has been taken offline.
