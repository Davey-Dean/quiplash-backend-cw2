# Quiplash Clone

This Project was created as a part of the Cloud Application Development Module at the University of Southampton.

We were tasked with creating a Quiplash Clone using Python and Azure for the backend, and NodeJS, Javascript and Google Cloud for the frontend.

This is the second half of the coursework which involed creating two clients (each interactive device, and a display device that everyone will see simultaneously), 
and the holding of the game state on a NodeJS server. Prompts and users will be called against the API created in the first part of the coursework. 
This part of the coursework will run the game aspect: People will submit the answers to the prompts, then score each others answers. 
Scoreboards will be displayed. The server was delpoyed onto Google Cloud's services to support online play.
